# TELOS — Your Name

> 🎯 SAMPLE TEMPLATE — this is the single source of truth for your TELOS (your mission, goals, problems, and the rest). Every entry below is a placeholder showing the SHAPE of the data. Run `/interview` (or just talk to your DA) to replace these samples with your real life context. Pulse reads this file to render your rings, freshness, and TELOS overview — it comes alive once you fill it in.

     and nested Work rows. Work rows are pipe-delimited:
