' PAI Pulse — hidden Windows launcher
' Launches the voice server (pulse.ts) at login with NO visible console window.
'
' Why VBScript via wscript.exe: bun.exe is a console-subsystem binary, so any
' Run-key entry or shortcut that points straight at bun/cmd flashes a console
' window every login. wscript.exe is a GUI-subsystem host; WshShell.Run(cmd, 0, False)
' passes SW_HIDE (window style 0) into the child's STARTUPINFO, so bun's console is
' created already-hidden. No flash, ever.
'
' Invoked at login by the per-user Startup-folder entry PAI-Pulse.vbs.
' macOS users keep using manage.sh + com.pai.pulse.plist (launchd); this file is Windows-only.
'
' Longevity note: VBScript/WSH is deprecated on Windows 11 24H2+ (feature-on-demand,
' slated for eventual removal). If WSH is disabled or .vbs is re-associated away from
' wscript by policy, this launcher fails silently. If Pulse ever stops auto-starting
' after a Windows update, that is the first thing to check (see ISA Decisions 2026-06-04).
