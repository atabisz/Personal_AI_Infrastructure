### Available Workflows

| Workflow | Description | Use When |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **UpdateData** | Fetch live data from ABS + RBA and update the AU-Common-Metrics dataset | "Update AU metrics", "refresh Australian data", "pull latest" |
| **GetCurrentState** | Comprehensive Australian economic overview with trend analysis | "How is the Australian economy?", "economic overview", "get current state" |

# Australian Metrics — Economic Indicator Analysis

**Purpose:** Analyse Australian economic metrics from the ABS Data API and RBA statistical tables. Provides trend analysis, cross-metric correlation, and structured economic overviews.

## Data Source

- **Location:** `${AU_METRICS_DIR}` or `~/Projects/Substrate/Data/AU-Common-Metrics/`
- **Master Document:** `AU-Common-Metrics.md`
- **Underlying sources:** ABS Data API (SDMX, keyless), RBA Statistical Tables (CSV, keyless)

**No API key is required.** Unlike the US equivalent (FRED/EIA keys), both Australian anchor sources are public and keyless: the ABS removed API keys on 2024-11-29, and the RBA publishes flat CSV tables.

## Workflows

### UpdateData

**Full documentation:** `Workflows/UpdateData.md`

**Execution:**
```bash
bun ~/.claude/skills/AustMetrics/Tools/UpdateAustMetrics.ts
```

**Outputs:**
- `AU-Common-Metrics.md` — updated with current values
- `au-metrics-current.csv` — machine-readable snapshot
- `au-metrics-historical.csv` — appended time series

### GetCurrentState

**Full documentation:** `Workflows/GetCurrentState.md`

**Produces:** A comprehensive overview analysing GDP, inflation, employment, housing, consumer, financial-markets, and trade indicators, with cross-metric interplay and research recommendations.

## Metric Categories Covered

1. **Economic Output & Growth** — real & nominal GDP, GDP growth (ABS National Accounts, quarterly)
2. **Inflation & Prices** — CPI index & annual inflation (ABS CPI, monthly since late 2025)
3. **Employment & Labour** — unemployment, participation, employed persons, emp-pop ratio, Wage Price Index (ABS Labour Force + WPI)
4. **Consumer** — Household Spending Indicator level & growth (ABS HSI, monthly)
5. **Housing** — mean dwelling price (ABS), standard variable mortgage rate (RBA F5)
6. **Financial Markets** — cash rate target, 2yr & 10yr govt bond yields (RBA F1.1, F2)
7. **Trade & International** — trade balance, exports, imports (ABS ITGS), AUD/USD & Trade-Weighted Index (RBA F11.1)
8. **Demographics** — Estimated Resident Population (ABS ERP, quarterly)

## API Keys Required

**None.** ABS Data API and RBA tables are both keyless. This is the main structural difference from USMetrics.

## Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `Tools/UpdateAustMetrics.ts` | **Primary** — fetch all 23 metrics from ABS + RBA, update dataset files |
| `Tools/FetchAbsSeries.ts` | Fetch a historical series from the ABS Data API with trend calculations |
| `Tools/GenerateAnalysis.ts` | Generate the Australian Economic State Analysis report |

## Documented Gaps (v1)

Some US metrics have no clean keyless Australian equivalent and are intentionally excluded:

- **Building approvals** — ABS `BA_SA2` has 662k series with no clean national aggregate key; housing is covered via dwelling prices + mortgage rates instead.
- **Consumer sentiment** — Westpac–Melbourne Institute, NAB, ANZ-Roy Morgan are all free-to-read but have no programmatic API (scrape-only).
- **Fuel/petrol prices** — no national API; state schemes exist (WA FuelWatch RSS free, NSW FuelCheck OAuth, QLD token).
- **Equity/volatility indices** — S&P/ASX 200 (`^AXJO`) and A-VIX (`^AXVI`) only via the unofficial Yahoo v8 endpoint.
- **Fiscal debt/deficit** — AOFM `.xlsx` + data.gov.au CKAN (Finance monthly statements); not wired into v1 (spreadsheet parsing, not SDMX).
- **Income distribution / GINI** — ABS Survey of Income & Housing is biennial, release-only, not a clean API dataflow.

## Example Usage

```
User: "How is the Australian economy doing?"

→ Invoke GetCurrentState workflow
→ Fetch current data for all metrics from ABS + RBA
→ Analyse cross-metric relationships (yield curve, housing affordability)
→ Output comprehensive markdown report
```
