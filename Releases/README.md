# LifeOS Releases

</div>

---

## What Are Releases?

Each release is a complete, installable snapshot. From **v6.0.0** onward LifeOS ships as a single self-contained skill your AI installs for you; earlier releases ship as complete `.claude/` directories you copy into your home folder.

This is the fastest way to get LifeOS running.

**A note on the older releases.** LifeOS began as **PAI (Personal AI Infrastructure)**. The earlier releases below — v2.3 through v5.0.0 — shipped under that name and framing before the rename; v5.0.0 reframed the system as a Life Operating System, and v6.0.0 is the first to ship as LifeOS. Same system, same lineage — they're kept here as the real history of how the Algorithm, skills, and memory came together.

> **Note:** The `.claude` directory is hidden by default on macOS/Linux. Use `ls -la` to see it.

## Available Releases

### v6.0.0 — The Life Operating System (Current)

LifeOS ships as a single self-contained skill, not a `.claude/` copy — the full framework installs through your AI.

- Algorithm v6.23.0
- Two-tier core components: Current→Ideal, the Algorithm, Skills, Hooks, Router, Pulse, custom spinner verbs, and custom tooltips, plus the supporting subsystems (Memory, Agents, Voice, Learning, Security)
- Skill-only distribution via the LifeOS install skill
- Full Pulse Life Dashboard + menu bar app

### v5.0.0 — Life Operating System

The release that reframed the whole system as a Life Operating System built around the move from current state to ideal state.

### v4.0.3 — Community PR Patch

4 community-contributed fixes from open PRs.

- Inference: JSON parsing now handles arrays `[]` alongside objects `{}`
- Documentation: removed 29 dead references from CONTEXT_ROUTING.md
- Portability: WorldThreatModelHarness uses `$PAI_DIR` instead of hardcoded path
- Installer: migrates user context from v2.5/v3.0 paths on upgrade

**[Get v4.0.3 →](v4.0.3/)**

---

### v4.0.2 — Bug Fix Patch

13 surgical fixes — no new features, no breaking changes.

- Linux compatibility: cross-platform OAuth token extraction, GNU coreutils `tr` fix
- Installer: correct alias path, shell detection (bash/fish/zsh), headless CLI fallback
- Statusline: width cache, algorithmVersion field, cross-platform OAuth
- Hooks: inference guard (~15s savings), lineage tracking, dead code removal, exit codes, voice config

### v4.0.1 — Upgrade Path & Preferences

Patch release addressing community feedback on upgrade difficulties and missing preferences.

- Upgrade path documentation with backup, merge, and post-upgrade checklist
- Configurable temperature unit (Fahrenheit/Celsius) in statusline
- Installer prompts for temperature preference during setup
- Statusline fixes: dynamic timezone, context fallback, startup estimate, f-string syntax (PRs #762, #780, #806)
- FAQ fixes (removed stale Python reference, improved recovery guidance)

### v2.3.0 — Continuous Learning

The release that introduced persistent learning and sentiment capture.

- 20 Skills, session continuity
- Implicit/explicit rating capture
- Memory system with WORK, STATE, LEARNING directories

**[Get v2.3 →](v2.3/)**

## Installation

**v6.0.0+** installs as a skill — give it to your AI. Paste this into any capable harness (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, …):

> **Read https://ourlifeos.ai/install and install LifeOS for me.**

Or the one-line shortcut for Claude Code on macOS/Linux:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://ourlifeos.ai/install.sh | bash
```

**Older releases (v2–v5)** ship as a `.claude/` directory you copy in:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/danielmiessler/LifeOS.git
cp -r LifeOS/Releases/v5.0.0/.claude ~/ && cd ~/.claude && bash install.sh
```

The wizard asks for your name, AI name, timezone, temperature unit, and optional voice preferences.

See the [main README](../README.md#upgrading-from-a-previous-version) for upgrade instructions.

## Troubleshooting

**Can't see .claude directory?** It's hidden. Use `ls -la ~/` or press `Cmd+Shift+.` in Finder.

**Hooks not firing?** Restart Claude Code after installation.
